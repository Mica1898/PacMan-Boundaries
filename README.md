# PacMan-Boundaries

**Pacman bouncing on the x axis**

**Description**
Currently in my bootcamp we are learning about DOM manipulation. In this project I learned how to create a function Run() and setting a setTimeOut() to make Pacman move along the x-acis. I created another function checkPageBounds() that uses an if statement that returns a direction change when Pacman hits the page boundary.
